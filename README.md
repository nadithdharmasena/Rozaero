## Problem Statement

Event organizers construct playlists to fulfill the music needs of their events. They fill it with their favorite songs and, unfortunately, their potentially unpopular tastes in music.

This system of playlist management presents a couple of problems. Most obviously, it leaves open the risk that guests will dislike the music tastes of the organizers. More importantly, the system offers guests no way of voicing their concerns and forces them to leave the event feeling disappointed. This lack of satisfaction among guests can translate into lower interest and revenues for future iterations of the event.

Luckily, Rozaero's cooperative playlist format introduces an innovative solution to these problems.
